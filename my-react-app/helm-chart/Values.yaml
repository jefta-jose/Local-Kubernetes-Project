service:
  type: NodePort
  port: 80
  containerPort: 5173
  # with nodePort as 5001, it will be accessible on localhost:5001
  # its like doing docker run -d -p 5001:5173 image-name
  
  #But Kubernetes restricts NodePorts to the range 30000â€“32767 by default. If you're using Docker Desktop, this might work, but for safety and portability, use something like:
  nodePort: 30001
