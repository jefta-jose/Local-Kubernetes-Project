Here‚Äôs a list of commonly used `kind` (Kubernetes IN Docker) commands you‚Äôll frequently use during local development and testing:

---

### üü¢ **Cluster Management**

#### ‚úÖ Create a cluster

```bash
kind create cluster
```

> Creates a cluster with the default name `kind`.

#### ‚úÖ Create a cluster with a custom name

```bash
kind create cluster --name my-cluster
```

#### ‚úÖ Create a cluster using a config file

```bash
kind create cluster --config kind-config.yaml
```

#### üõë Delete the default cluster

```bash
kind delete cluster
```

#### üõë Delete a named cluster

```bash
kind delete cluster --name my-cluster
```

#### üìã List kind clusters

```bash
kind get clusters
```

---

### üß∞ **Working with Nodes**

#### üìã List nodes in a cluster

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

#### üß™ Get info about a kind node container

```bash
docker ps
```

---

### üîÅ **Networking and Port Forwarding**

#### üåê Load a local Docker image into kind

```bash
kind load docker-image my-image:tag
```

#### üõ†Ô∏è Expose a local port to access the cluster

Kind doesn‚Äôt support LoadBalancer, so you'll use `kubectl port-forward` or Ingress.

```bash
kubectl port-forward service/my-service 8080:80
```

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Advanced**

#### üîç View kubeconfig path for kind

```bash
kind get kubeconfig-path --name my-cluster
```

> Deprecated in recent versions ‚Äî use the standard kubeconfig in `$HOME/.kube/config`.

#### üîÑ Restart kind cluster (delete + recreate)

```bash
kind delete cluster --name my-cluster && kind create cluster --name my-cluster
```

---

### üßæ Example  File (`kind-.yaml`)

```yaml
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
  - role: control-plane
  - role: worker
  - role: worker
```

`Chart.yaml` is one of the **core files** in every Helm chart. It acts like the **"package.json" of a Helm chart**, describing metadata about the chart itself.

---

### üß≠ **What is `Chart.yaml` in Helm?**

In the context of Helm, `Chart.yaml`:

* Defines **metadata** about your Helm chart.
* Tells Helm what this chart is, what version it is, and optionally what app version it deploys.
* Is **required** for every chart. Helm will refuse to package or install a chart without it.

---

### üîç **Breakdown of your example**

```yaml
apiVersion: v2
name: react-app
description: A Helm chart for React App
version: 0.1.0
appVersion: "1.0"
```

| Field               | Meaning                                                                                                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apiVersion: v2`    | Helm chart API version. Use `v2` for Helm 3.                                                                  |
| `name: react-app`   | The name of the chart ‚Äî also used in the release name.                                                        |
| `description`       | A short explanation of what the chart does.                                                                   |
| `version: 0.1.0`    | The version of the **chart package**, not the app itself. This follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/).         |
| `appVersion: "1.0"` | The version of the actual application (e.g., the React app) being deployed. Used mostly for display purposes. |

---

### üì¶ Where is `Chart.yaml` used?

* When you run `helm install`, Helm uses this file to identify and describe the chart.
* When you push or share charts (e.g., to a Helm repo), this file provides the metadata Helm uses to list it.
* It's used by `helm dependency` if your chart relies on other charts.

---

### üîÑ Example with dependencies

```yaml
apiVersion: v2
name: my-app
version: 1.2.3
dependencies:
  - name: mongodb
    version: 10.2.0
    repository: "https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami"
```

This declares that your chart depends on the `mongodb` chart.

---

---

### üß≠ **What is `values.yaml` in Helm?**

The `values.yaml` file is where you define **default uration values** for your Helm chart ‚Äî it acts like a global config for your Kubernetes templates.

These values get **injected into the templates** (under `templates/`) via Helm‚Äôs Go templating engine using the syntax `{{ .Values.<key> }}`.

---

### üîç **Breakdown of your example**

```yaml
replicaCount: 3
```

* This sets the number of pod replicas, likely used in a `Deployment.yaml` template like:

  ```yaml
  replicas: {{ .Values.replicaCount }}
  ```

```yaml
image:
  repository: react-kube-demo
  pullPolicy: Never
```

* This configures the Docker image to use.
* In the `Deployment.yaml`, it might look like:

  ```yaml
  image: "{{ .Values.image.repository }}"
  imagePullPolicy: {{ .Values.image.pullPolicy }}
  ```

```yaml
service:
  type: NodePort
  port: 80
```

* These values configure the Kubernetes Service resource.
* Your `service.yaml` might look like:

  ```yaml
  type: {{ .Values.service.type }}
  ports:
    - port: {{ .Values.service.port }}
  ```

---

### ‚úÖ **Why is `values.yaml` useful?**

* **Reusable charts**: Instead of hardcoding things, you define variables.
* **Override flexibility**: You can change behavior at install/upgrade time:

  ```bash
  helm install react-demo ./my-chart -f custom-values.yaml
  ```

  Or override on the CLI:

  ```bash
  helm install react-demo ./my-chart \
    --set replicaCount=2,image.pullPolicy=Always
  ```

### üß† TL;DR

| File          | Purpose                                                  |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Chart.yaml`  | Metadata about the chart (name, version, dependencies)   |
| `values.yaml` | Default user-configurable values injected into templates |

---

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Deployment YAML**

* **Purpose:** Manages **how your application is deployed** and run inside Kubernetes Pods.
* **Think of it like:** `docker run` or `docker-compose up` ‚Äî it handles container creation, scaling, and updating.
* **Key responsibilities:**

  * Defines **how many replicas** (pods) to run.
  * Specifies **which container image** to use.
  * Tells Kubernetes **what port(s)** the container exposes.
  * Handles **rolling updates, self-healing**, and restarts.

‚úÖ **In short:**

> The Deployment ensures that the desired number of containers are running with the correct version of your app.

---

### üåê **Service YAML**

* **Purpose:** Exposes a **stable network endpoint** to access the app running in the Pods created by the Deployment.
* **Think of it like:** Setting up `-p` (port mapping) or load balancer access in Docker.
* **Key responsibilities:**

  * Gives a **permanent IP/hostname** to your Pods (which are otherwise ephemeral).
  * Handles **load balancing** across multiple pods.
  * Can expose the app:

    * Internally (ClusterIP)
    * To the host machine (NodePort)
    * Outside the cluster (LoadBalancer or Ingress)

‚úÖ **In short:**

> The Service allows traffic **to reach your application**, no matter how many pods are running or where they are.

---

### üß† Visual Analogy

Imagine you're running a pizza shop:

* **Deployment** = You hire 3 chefs (pods) who know how to make your pizza recipe (image).
* **Service** = The front counter that customers use to place their orders (access point to reach your chefs).
